# STAR-Edge

In this work, we presented **STAR-Edge**, a novel point cloud edge extraction approach specifically designed for thin-walled structures. The core of our method is the introduction of a new structure-aware neighborhood representationâ€”the local spherical curve. This representation effectively emphasizes co-planar points while minimizing interference from unrelated surfaces, enabling robust and accurate edge detection in complex thin-walled geometries.

  ```
  |-- dataset/
      |-- thin_walled/
          |-- gt
          |-- pc
  |-- dataset_pre/
      |-- pre_data_thin/
          |-- cls_gt
          |-- desc
          |-- pc_normal
  
  ```


## Usage

#### Train
